## 🎯 Core Innovation: Custom Crop Yield Risk Index

The centerpiece of this platform is a **proprietary Crop Yield Risk Index** that synthesizes multiple climate factors into a single, actionable risk score (0-100) for major U.S. crops.

### Methodology

The risk index is calculated using a weighted composite algorithm:

```
Risk Score = (Rainfall Deficit × 0.30) +
             (Soil Moisture Stress × 0.25) +
             (Heat Stress × 0.25) +
             (Drought Severity × 0.20)
```

#### Factor Definitions:

1. **Rainfall Deficit (30% weight)**

   - Compares current precipitation to 30-year historical baseline
   - Accounts for crop-specific water requirements during critical growth stages
   - Data source: Open-Meteo Historical Weather API

2. **Soil Moisture Stress (25% weight)**

   - Measures soil moisture content (0-100% of field capacity)
   - Critical for root development and nutrient uptake
   - Derived from soil moisture models at 0-10cm depth

3. **Heat Stress (25% weight)**

   - Tracks extreme temperature events (>35°C for most crops)
   - Calculates cumulative heat stress during sensitive growth periods
   - Particularly critical during pollination and grain fill stages

4. **Drought Severity (20% weight)**
   - Based on U.S. Drought Monitor classification (D0-D4)
   - Integrates multiple drought indicators
   - Weighted by duration and intensity

### Crop-Specific Calibration

The index is calibrated for five major U.S. crops, each with unique growth stage sensitivities:

| Crop     | Critical Stages            | Base Temp (GDD) | Primary Risk Factors       |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Corn     | Pollination (Jun-Jul)      | 10°C            | Heat stress, water deficit |
| Wheat    | Heading (Apr-May)          | 0°C             | Drought, frost             |
| Soybeans | Flowering (Jul-Aug)        | 10°C            | Water stress, heat         |
| Cotton   | Boll Development (Jul-Aug) | 12°C            | Heat, drought              |
| Rice     | Grain Fill (Jul-Aug)       | 10°C            | Water availability         |
